# Advanced Human Pose Recognition and Analysis System

## Overview
This project uses OpenCV and TensorFlow for real-time human pose estimation on images and videos, visualizing body parts and connections.

## Features
- Real-time pose estimation from images, videos, or camera feed.
- Visualizes detected body parts and connections.
- Configurable input and output paths.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
